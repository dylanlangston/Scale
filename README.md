# Scale Game 🧗‍♂️
This is a submission to the 2023 *Game Off* event hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) on [itch.io](https://itch.io/), It's a game developed using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) via [Raylib-Zig](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig/tree/devel). It was created by [@dylanlangston](https://github.com/dylanlangston).

#### What's Game Off? [^1]

> [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) is GitHub's annual game jam challenging individuals and teams to build a game during the month of November. Use whatever programming languages, game engines, or libraries you like. You're also welcome to use AI tools to help generate code, assets, or anything in between!
>
> The theme for this year's jam is **SCALE**!

#### My submission

My interpretion of the theme is a vertical platformer that is procedurally generated. 

#### Getting Started
1. Install Zig version 0.11.0 using the [instructions here](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig).
2. Configure you build environment for Raylib using the appropriate [instructions](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki#development-platforms) for you platform.
3. Finally, to start the game run the command `zig build run`. Alternatively run the **_Debug_** task in VSCode.
